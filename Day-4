Leanr about Microsoft Azure

Here are some of the tasks that I performed while learning Azure:

Task 1: Introduction to Azure DevOps and Creating a new project.

Task 2:  Setting up Azure DevOps projects, creating teams, and inviting team members.

Task 3: Creating and importing work items in Azure DevOps Boards.

Task 4: Customizing Azure DevOps Boards and filtering work items.

Task 5: Exploring Azure DevOps backlogs, and organizing workloads into sprints.

Here's the screenshot of tasks!

int start=1;
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                    for (int j = 0; j <=i; j++) {
                        if((i+j)%2==0){
                            System.out.print("1 ");
                        }
                        else {
                            System.out.print("0 ");
                        }
                    }
                System.out.println();
            }
